I just wanted to put a guide in here to look back on when i need a little reminder of the exact goals of this project.

I began building this mainly as a tool for when i am created a simple node js server, and want to speed up the process.

Main rest endpoints we want to have when a router or rest file is generated:

GET all of the instances of a certain model

GET a single instance of a certain model by id

POST a single new instance of a certain model

PATCH a single instance of a certain model

DELETE a single instance of a certain model
